# Paul Browne Music Website

Website for first milestone project for Code Institute Full Stack Web Developer course.
This is a musicians website themed and styled in order to promote and sell a new album.

## UX

The goal of the website is to generate interest in the musician, inform those interested and  promote a new album, though a user friendly experience.

### User Stories

* As a somebody new to the artist I want to see and hear about the artist, hear a sample of the musicians work and access it easily through effective navigation.

* As an existing fan I'm interested in seeing what is new about the artist, see the availability of a new album for sale.

* As a music promoter/agency, I want to be able to easily contact the musician for gigs or recording opportunities.

## Features

* **Home Page** - A vibrant landing page image with immediate promotion and quick access for the new album, menu for navigation in icon top right for easy access.

* **Bio** - A biography page giving general information on the musician.

*  **Media** - A webpage with carousel of images of the artist performing, a video with a live song sample, some lyrics to the song.

* **Contact** - A contact page with album cover and link to buy, a form for contacting the musician.

* **Navigation** - The website features a navigation style inspired by the navigation from https://hozier.com/, which is created using Reactjs. I wanted to emulate that style of full screen drop down using mainly HTML an CSS, although some lines of javaScript were required.

* **Footer** - Each page of the website features a footer with links to social media, youtube, and Spotify.

## Testing

1. A tool for testing website responsiveness is the site http://ami.responsivedesign.is/, where the developer can view and interact their website shown on different device sizes. It was used for testing responsiveness of this website.


2. Tested on browsers - Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Microsoft Internet Edge and Apple Safari.

3. Chrome DevTools was used extensively in the building of this website. 

4. For testing on different devices I used personal Android(Samsung S9), and relatives Apple iPad, iPhone 6, MacBook Pro.  Website performed consistently on all devices used for testing.

5. Checked all links were working, on media page carousel and videos work correctly.

6. On contact page, if submitting the form with any empty fields a message "Please fill out this field".  When Submit button is clicked, your PC will open it's default email program.

**Open Issues**

Testing problems include footer slightly too large on max-width: 600px devices.  Some spacing issues with max-width 600px devices.

## Deployment

1. Used Github to create a repository and uploaded files to url: https://github.com/pbtrad/Project-idea-5.

2. In order to publish files to see on the web, I selected settings - Github Pages -Source - master branch. After page refresh url for page is available.

3. To run the website code on your local machine, go to my Github repository at https://github.com/pbtrad/Project-idea-5, click "Clone or download", this will give you options to clone with HTTPS, open on desktop, or download as a zip file. Open Git Bash
Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory to be made.
Type git clone, and then paste this URL; https://github.com/pbtrad/Project-idea-5.git Press Enter. Your local clone will be created.
